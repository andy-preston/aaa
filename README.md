# AAA - Andy's AVR Assembler

An AVR assembler with:

* macros
* memory allocation
* symbolic register names
* embedded JavaScript

## Dependencies

* Deno

## Status

This is almost an M.V.P.

It blows my mind that it (almost) works.
It would blow my mind even more to find out someone else was using it.

I still don't trust the code it produces though... I like to double check it
against something more reliable... I like GAVRASM.
